# STM32 DHT11/DHT22 Library

---
**Description:**  
DHT11/DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor driver for AVR microcontrollers.  
+ This library does not use any hardware timer or interrupts.  
+ By contrast, the readings are accomplished with delays.  
+ Functions include:  
  + Reading raw data in an array.  
  + Getting the calculated temperature and/or humidity directly.  
  + Converting the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin or Fahrenheit units.  
  _Read the bottom of "DHT.h" to see all functions available._  

The original Code has been written for AVR MCU and this fork modifed the libaray to work with Stm32 MCU
